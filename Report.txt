# Benchmarking Report

## System Overview
- Object detection is implemented using YOLOv8 with Python.
- Video processing is optimized for CPU to achieve real-time inference.

## Test Setup
- **Hardware:** Intel i5 Processor, 8GB RAM
- **Software:** Python 3.8, OpenCV, PyTorch
- **Test Video:** 1920x1080 resolution, 30 FPS

## Results
- Average inference speed: 25 FPS
- Benchmarking was performed on 500 frames of video input.
- Frame Processing Time: ~40ms per frame.

## Optimization Techniques
1. Reduced model size by using YOLOv8 Nano (`yolov8n.pt`).
2. Efficient preprocessing and postprocessing pipelines.
3. Optimized bounding box generation using batch processing.

## Future Improvements
