<!-- To run this project first install the libraries..ie. -->

pip install torch
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python



<!-- once you install all the libraries run the main.py file with containing a video path for which you want to perform the operation..ie.. -->
python main.py --video "C:\\Users\\lenovo\\Documents\\safetywhatassign\\videoo.mp4"



After that you will get the output in image format that contain the object and subobject as a snapshot.
